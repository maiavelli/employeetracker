# Employee Tracker
![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)

An employee database management system that uses command line, node.js, and mySQL to allow you to view and manage the employees, departments, and roles in your company. 

## Usage 

To use this application, first clone this repository and create a `.env` file using the format in the `.envEXAMPLE` with your mySQL credentials. You may also edit `seeds.sql` with your company data, or you may enter your data via the application. 

Then, log into mySQL on your command line and run the following code: 

```md
source /db/schema.sql
```

If you decided to create a seed file, run the same code again afterward, with `/db/seeds.sql` as the source. 

Next, exit mySQL, and run the following command: 

```md
node index.js
```

Once the program is started, follow the prompts and use the application to view, edit, and add to your company's departments, roles, and employees.
